## Project Overview

AIFootballPredictions aims to create a predictive model to forecast whether a football match will exceed 2.5 goals and predict corner outcomes (Over/Under 10.5 corners). The project is divided into four main stages:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Download and merge historical football match data from multiple European leagues.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Process the raw data to engineer features (including corner statistics), handle missing values, and select the most relevant features.
3. **Model Training**: Train several machine learning models for both goals and corners predictions, perform hyperparameter tuning, and combine the best models into voting classifiers.
4. **Making Predictions**: Use the trained models to predict outcomes for upcoming matches (goals and/or corners) and generate a formatted message for sharing.

## Directory Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

```
└─── `AIFootballPredictions`
    ├─── `conda`: all the conda environemnts
    ├─── `data`: the folder for the data
    │       ├─── `processed`
    │       └─── `raw`
    ├─── `models`: the folder with the saved and trained models
    ├─── `notebooks`: all the notebooks if any
    └─── `scripts`: all the python scripts
            ├─── `data_acquisition.py`

            ├─── `train_models.py`
            ├─── `acquire_next_matches.py`
            └─── `make_predictions.py`
```


### Key Scripts

- **`data_acquisition.py`**: Downloads and merges football match data from specified leagues and seasons.
- **`data_preprocessing.py`**: Preprocesses the raw data, performs feature engineering (including corner feature extraction), and selects the most relevant features for both goals and corners predictions.
- **`train_models.py`**: Trains machine learning models for goal predictions (Over/Under 2.5), performs hyperparameter tuning, and saves the best models with feature lists.
- **`train_corner_models.py`**: Trains machine learning models for corner predictions (Over/Under 10.5), performs hyperparameter tuning, and saves the best models with feature lists.
- **`acquire_next_matches.py`**: Acquires the next football matches data, updates team names using a mapping file, and saves the results to a JSON file.
- **`make_predictions_enhanced.py`**: Uses the trained models to predict outcomes for upcoming matches and formats the results into a readable txt message (supports both goals and corners predictions).

**Note**: It is suggested to avoid path errors by executing all scripts from the root folder. 

## Setup and Installation

To set up the environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AIFootballPredictions.git
   cd AIFootballPredictions
   ```

2. Create a conda environment

   ```bash
   conda env create -f conda/aifootball_predictions.yaml
   conda activate aifootball_predictions
   ```

## Data Acquisition

To download and merge football match data, run the `data_acquisition.py` script:

```bash
python scripts/data_acquisition.py --leagues E0 I1 SP1 F1 D1 --seasons 2526 2425 2324 2223 --raw_data_output_dir data/raw
```
This script downloads match data from [football-data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk/) for the specified leagues and seasons, merges them, and saves the results to the specified output directory.

To avoid error please see the [Supported Leagues](#supported-leagues) sections. 

## Data Preprocessing

Once the raw data is downloaded, preprocess it by running the `data_preprocessing.py` script:

```bash
python scripts/data_preprocessing.py --raw_data_input_dir data/raw --processed_data_output_dir data/processed --num_features 50 --clustering_threshold 0.5
```
This script processes each CSV file in the input folder, performs feature engineering (creating corner statistics features), selects relevant features while addressing feature correlation, handles missing values, and saves the processed data with both goal and corner prediction targets.

## Model Training

To train machine learning models for goal predictions (Over/Under 2.5 Goals), use the `train_models.py` script:

```bash
python scripts/train_models.py --processed_data_input_dir data/processed --trained_models_output_dir models --metric_choice accuracy --n_splits 10 --voting soft
```
This script processes each CSV file individually, trains several machine learning models, performs hyperparameter tuning, combines the best models into a voting classifier, saves the trained models, and exports the selected feature lists as JSON files for reproducible predictions.

### Training Corner Prediction Models

To train models for predicting corners (Over/Under 10.5), use the `train_corner_models.py` script:

```bash
python scripts/train_corner_models.py --processed_data_input_dir data/processed --trained_models_output_dir models --metric_choice accuracy --n_splits 10 --voting soft
```
This creates additional models (`*_corner_voting_classifier.pkl`) that predict whether a match will have over or under 10.5 total corners, with corner-specific feature selections saved as JSON files.

## Upcoming Matches Acquisition

To acquire the next football matches data and update the team names, run the `acquire_next_matches.py` script:

```bash
python scripts/acquire_next_matches.py --get_teams_names_dir data/processed --next_matches_output_file data/next_matches.json
```
This script will:

- Fetch the next matches data from the [football-data.org API](https://www.football-data.org/).
- Read the unique team names from the processed data files.
- Update the team names in the next matches data using the mapping file.
    - This step is necessary because the teams' names acquired with the [football-data.org API](https://www.football-data.org/) differ from the teams' names acquired from [football-data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk/), which've been used to train the ML models. 
- Save the updated next matches to a JSON file.

### Setup the API_KEY 

In order to properly execute the `acquire_next_matches.py` script it is first necessary to set up the API_KEY to gather the next matches information. Below the procedure on how to properly set up the variable:

1. **Register for an API Key:**
   - Go to the [Football-Data.org website](https://www.football-data.org/) and register to get your personal API key.

2. **Create a `~/.env` File:**
   - This file will be used by the `load_dotenv` library to set up the `API_FOOTBALL_DATA` environment variable.
   - To create the file:
     - Open your terminal and run the command: `vim ~/.env`
     - This will create a new `~/.env` file if it doesn't already exist.

3. **Insert the API Key:**
   - After running the `vim` command, press the `i` key (for "insert mode").
   - Write down the following line, replacing `your_personal_key` with your actual API key:
     - `API_FOOTBALL_DATA=your_personal_key`

4. **Save and Exit:**
   - Press the `Esc` key to exit insert mode.
   - Then, type `:wq!` and press `Enter` to save the changes and exit the editor.

5. **Verify the Variable:**
   - To check if the variable has been properly set, run the following command from the terminal:
     - `cat ~/.env`
   - You should see the `API_FOOTBALL_DATA` variable listed with your API key.

## Making Predictions

To predict the outcomes for upcoming matches and generate a formatted message, run the `make_predictions_enhanced.py` script:

**For goals predictions only:**
```bash
python scripts/make_predictions_enhanced.py --input_leagues_models_dir models --input_data_predict_dir data/processed --final_predictions_out_file data/final_predictions.txt --next_matches data/next_matches.json
```

**For both goals and corners predictions:**
```bash
python scripts/make_predictions_enhanced.py --input_leagues_models_dir models --input_data_predict_dir data/processed --final_predictions_out_file data/final_predictions_with_corners.txt --next_matches data/next_matches.json --predict_corners
```

This script will:
- Load the pre-trained voting classifier models for each league.
- Load the saved feature lists (JSON files) to ensure feature alignment between training and prediction.
- Make predictions for upcoming matches based on the next matches data.
- Format the predictions into a readable `.txt` message with prediction confidence scores.
- If `--predict_corners` flag is used, include corner predictions (Over/Under 10.5 Corners) alongside goal predictions.

**Output Format Example:**
```
- ⚽ **Man United** 🆚 **West Ham**: Under 2.5 Goals (89.69% chance) | Over 10.5 Corners: 72.97%
```

## Supported Leagues

For the moment, the team name mapping has been done manually. The predictions currently support the following leagues:

- *Premier League*: **E0**
- *Serie A*: **I1**
- *Ligue 1*: **F1**
- *La Liga (Primera Division)*: **SP1**
- *Bundesliga*: **D1**

For this reason be carful when executing the [data acquisition](#data-acquisition) step.
